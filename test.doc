Hello Donna, Steve & Eric

Thank you very much for taking out the time and talking to me about the position at Nationwide, I believe the job responsibilities of the position closely relates to my experience as I have built and I am currently supporting batch based applications interfacing with oracle database built on JAVA leveraging JDBC, I also worked extensively on UNIX platforms and very comfortable with bash and Perl scripting and I have also worked in migrating legacy applications to new stack. I believe I will be good fit for the position and I am excited about the opportunity.

Thank you once again for considering me for the position and taking the time to explain the details of the architecture and development stack. looking forward to hear back.

Regards

Nitesh
